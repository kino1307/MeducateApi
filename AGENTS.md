## What this project is

MeducateAPI is a medical education REST API that automatically discovers health topics from MedlinePlus and PubMed, processes them through GPT-4 via Semantic Kernel, and serves structured data (summary, observations, risk factors, actions, citations) over a clean API. It is a portfolio project hosted live at [meducateapi.com](https://meducateapi.com).

- **Web dashboard**: meducateapi.com (Blazor Server)
- **REST API**: api.meducateapi.com (ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs)
- **Hosting**: Railway (hobby tier), Cloudflare CDN/DNS
- **Monitoring**: UptimeRobot on both domains

## Solution layout

```
src/
  Meducate.Domain/          Entities, repository interfaces, service contracts. Zero dependencies.
  Meducate.Application/     Business logic, Hangfire jobs, DTOs, ingestion/refresh orchestration.
  Meducate.Infrastructure/  EF Core + PostgreSQL, Semantic Kernel + OpenAI, Resend email, API key hashing.
  Meducate.API/             Minimal API endpoints, middleware pipeline, Swagger, auth setup.
  Meducate.Web/             Blazor Server dashboard (separate app, calls Meducate.API over HTTP).
tests/
  Meducate.Tests/           xUnit unit tests. No test framework beyond xUnit — no fixtures, no mocks framework.
```

Clean Architecture: dependencies point inward only. Domain has no external dependencies. Infrastructure implements Domain interfaces.

## Key entities (Meducate.Domain/Entities/)

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `HealthTopic` | Core medical topic. Fields: Name, Summary, Observations, Factors, Actions, Citations, Category, TopicType, Tags, Version. Internal fields (RawSource, SourceHash, NeedsLlmReprocessing, ReprocessAttempts, OriginalName, LastSourceRefresh) are `[JsonIgnore]`. |
| `User` | Passwordless. Holds email, verification token + expiry, security stamp, consent timestamps. |
| `Organisation` | One per user. Owns API keys. |
| `ApiClient` | API key with PBKDF2-hashed secret + salt. Tracks DailyLimit, IsActive, ExpiresAt, LastUsedAt. |
| `ApiUsageLog` | Per-request log. Stores path, method, status, query string, organisation name. No raw IP (GDPR). |
| `SeenTopic` | Deduplication table. Records every topic name the ingestion pipeline has classified, including non-medical and filtered types, so they are never re-discovered. |

---

## Auth flow

Magic-link email only, no passwords.

1. `POST /api/users/register` creates or retrieves user, sends verification or login email via Resend.
2. `POST /api/users/verify` validates token, calls `AuthSignIn.SignInAsync`, sets cookie `meducateapi_auth`.
3. Cookie: 8 hr absolute, 7-day max, sliding renewal. Security stamp checked every 5 min (`StampCheckIntervalSeconds = 300`).
4. CSRF protection via `X-Requested-By` header (checked in `CsrfProtectionMiddleware`).
5. Account deletion requires a fresh session (signed in within last 10 min, `FreshAuthWindowSeconds = 600`).

---

## API key system

- Format: `{keyId}.{secret}`
- Secret PBKDF2-hashed on creation (`ApiKeyHasher`: SHA-256, 100k iterations, 16-byte salt, 32-byte hash, stored as separate `Salt` column). Plain key shown once only.
- Max 5 active keys per org (`MaxKeysPerOrg = 5`). Managed via the Organisations endpoints below (create/list/rename/delete key).
- `ApiKeyMiddleware` validates the key and enforces the daily limit. Caches client (30s TTL) and usage count (15s TTL) in `IMemoryCache`.
- `UsageLoggingMiddleware` logs every authenticated request and fires an 80%-threshold email warning via Hangfire.
- Rate limit headers `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` are set only on `[RequiresApiKey]` endpoints, only after successful key validation (`ApiKeyMiddleware`) — not on every response.
- Global rate limit: 60 req/min, via ASP.NET Core `RateLimiter` partitioned by API key ID (or by IP for unauthenticated requests).

**Demo key** (seeded at startup, intentionally public):
```
X-Api-Key: d3m0000000000000000000000000key1.MEDUCATE_PUBLIC_DEMO_2026
```
Limit: 50 requests/day.

All public API routes are versioned under `/api/v1` via `app.MapGroup("/api/v1")` in `MiddlewarePipeline.cs`. `/health`, `/hangfire`, and `/internal/*` are intentionally unversioned (operational/internal, not the public API surface).

## Topic endpoints (all require `X-Api-Key`)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/topics` | Paginated list. Params: `skip`, `take` (max 200), `type`. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/topics/search` | Name partial-match. Same pagination params + `type` filter. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/topics/{name}` | Single topic by exact name. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/topics/types` | Distinct topic types in the DB. |

Response field names adapt to `TopicType` via `HealthTopicJsonConverter`. Each `TopicType` (Disease, Symptom, Drug, Procedure, Diagnostic Test, Vaccine, Anatomy, Nutrient, Mental Health, Lifestyle) gets its own field-name triplet — e.g. a Disease returns `symptoms`/`causes`/`treatments`, a Symptom returns `relatedSymptoms`/`associatedConditions`/`management`.

---

## Auth/account & organisation endpoints (`Meducate.API/Endpoints/AuthEndpoints.cs`, `OrgEndpoints.cs`, `WaitlistEndpoints.cs`)

Require the `MeducateAPIAuth` cookie (`[Authorize]`) unless noted:

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Sign out. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/users/register` | `[AllowAnonymous]`. Register/sign-in via magic link. Honeypot + timing bot checks. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/users/verify` | `[AllowAnonymous]`. Validates token, signs in. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users/me` | Current user + org + whether they have active keys. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/users/me` | Delete account. Requires fresh session (`FreshAuthWindowSeconds`). |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/waitlist` | `[AllowAnonymous]`. Waitlist signup. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/orgs` | Create the caller's organisation (one per user). |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/orgs/{id}/keys` | Create an API key for an org (enforces `MaxKeysPerOrg`). |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orgs/{id}/keys` | List active keys + today's usage per key. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/orgs/{orgId}/keys/{keyId}` | Rename a key. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/orgs/{orgId}/keys/{keyId}` | Revoke (disable) a key. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orgs/{id}/usage/history` | Daily usage counts across the org's keys. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orgs/{id}/usage/top-endpoints` | Most-used endpoints across the org's keys. |

Health checks (unauthenticated): `GET /health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`.

---

## Background jobs (Hangfire, PostgreSQL-backed)

| Job | Schedule | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TopicDiscoveryJob` | 2 AM UTC daily | Discovers new topics from all providers, LLM-classifies and extracts structured data, deduplicates, removes stale topics, backfills missing fields. |
| `TopicRefreshJob` | 3 AM UTC daily | Re-processes existing topics whose source has changed or are flagged `NeedsLlmReprocessing`. |
| `DataIntegrityCheckJob` | 4 AM UTC daily | Verifies data quality after refresh. |

On non-development startup, `TopicRefreshJob` is enqueued immediately to catch up on any missed run.

Hangfire dashboard: `/hangfire`, protected by `HangfireDashboardAuthFilter` — a standalone shared-password scheme unrelated to user auth. Password comes from `Hangfire:DashboardPassword` config, submitted via `?password=` query string, then remembered in its own `HangfireAuth` cookie (12hr).

---

## Internal endpoints (require `X-Internal-Token` header, not public)

```
POST /internal/jobs/{jobName}              Enqueue a named job
GET  /internal/jobs/{jobName}/last-run     Last run result
GET  /internal/topics/sample               Random topic sample for inspection
GET  /internal/topics/fact-check           Topics with raw source attached for QA
```

Known job names: `data-integrity-check`, `refresh-medical-conditions`, `discover-medical-conditions`.

---

## Middleware pipeline order

```
ForwardedHeaders -> HTTPS redirect/HSTS -> ResponseCompression -> Routing -> CORS
-> GlobalExceptionMiddleware -> SecurityHeadersMiddleware -> ETagMiddleware
-> CorrelationIdMiddleware -> RequestTimingMiddleware -> RateLimiter
-> Authentication -> Authorization -> CsrfProtectionMiddleware
-> ApiKeyMiddleware -> UsageLoggingMiddleware
-> Swagger -> HangfireDashboard -> Endpoints
```

---

## Data providers

- `MedlinePlusDataProvider` — fetches topic index from MedlinePlus XML API.
- `PubMedDataProvider` — fetches from PubMed E-utilities.
- Both implement `IMedicalDataProvider` (`DiscoverTopicsAsync`, `GetKnownTopicNamesAsync`, `FetchTopicDataAsync`, `SourceName`).

---

## LLM processing (Semantic Kernel + OpenAI)

- Kernel built in `SemanticKernelBuilder`. Model defaults to `gpt-4o-mini` unless overridden by `OpenAI:Model` config.
- `ILLMProcessor` methods:
  - `ClassifyTopicNamesAsync` — assigns a TopicType to each candidate.
  - `ClassifyTopicCategoriesAsync` — assigns a category to each candidate.
  - `ParseHealthTopicAsync` — extracts structured fields from raw source.
  - `VerifyHealthTopicAsync` — second-pass quality check.
  - `CompareBroaderNameAsync` — resolves synonym collisions.
  - `MatchOriginalNamesAsync` — matches source-provider names back to canonical topic names.
  - `ShouldProcessTopicType` — filters non-medical / non-processable types.
  - `GetValidCategories()` — allowed category list.
- 500ms throttle between LLM calls (`LlmThrottle`, in `TopicIngestionService` / `TopicRefreshService`) to avoid rate-limit errors.

---

## Configuration keys (never commit real values)

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `OpenAI:ApiKey` | OpenAI key |
| `OpenAI:Model` | Model ID (default `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `Resend:ApiToken` | Resend email API key |
| `Resend:FromAddress` | From-address used when sending via Resend |
| `Internal:TriggerToken` | Bearer token for `/internal/*` endpoints |
| `App:BaseUrl` | Public base URL used to build magic-link URLs |
| `Cors:AllowedOrigins` | Array of allowed origins for CORS |
| `Hangfire:DashboardPassword` | Password for the `/hangfire` dashboard (see above) |
| `Admin:AlertEmail` | Recipient for data-integrity-check and error alerts |
| `PubMed:ApiKey` | PubMed E-utilities API key |
| `Api:BaseUrl` / `Api:PublicUrl` | (Meducate.Web) base URLs for calling `Meducate.API` |

Use `dotnet user-secrets` locally. Railway environment variables in production.

---

## Tests

xUnit only, no mocking framework. Tests use real implementations or minimal hand-rolled fakes. Run with `dotnet test`. Coverage: middleware, helpers, DTOs, entity logic. No integration tests against a live DB.

---

## Web app (Meducate.Web)

Blazor Server. Calls `Meducate.API` over HTTP via `ApiService`. Auth cookies forwarded via `CookieForwardingHandler`. Pages: Home, Docs, Pricing, Register, Verify, Dashboard, Account, CreateOrganisation, GenerateKey, Blog, FAQ, UseCases, Privacy, Terms, and SEO landing pages.

---

## Coding conventions

- Minimal API endpoints in `Endpoints/`, each file a static class with a `MapXEndpoints` extension method.
- DI registration in `DependencyInjection/` extension methods — only `Meducate.API` and `Meducate.Infrastructure` have one; `Meducate.Infrastructure`'s also registers Application-layer services (jobs, ingestion/refresh services). `Meducate.Web` registers its own services inline in `Program.cs`.
- EF Core config via `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>` in `Persistence/Configurations/`.
- Migrations in `Meducate.Infrastructure/Migrations/`. Apply with `dotnet ef migrations add` targeting the Infrastructure project. `ApplyMigrationsAsync()` runs at startup.
- `internal sealed` on everything that isn't part of a project's public API. Each project grants `InternalsVisibleTo` to the projects/tests that consume it, so `internal` types (e.g. `ITopicRepository`, `ILLMProcessor`) do cross project boundaries via IVT rather than staying strictly project-local.
- No comments unless the why is non-obvious. No XML doc blocks.

---

## Commit convention

Squash all changes into a single commit, amend + force push master. Commit message is always:

```
MeducateAPI - Medical education API platform
```

Do not deviate without being asked.

---

## Security reminders

- This repo is public (portfolio piece). Never commit secrets, connection strings, API keys, or internal tokens.
- The demo key and its daily limit are intentionally public — they are not secrets.
- Before writing anything sensitive to memory files or committing, flag it to the user first.
