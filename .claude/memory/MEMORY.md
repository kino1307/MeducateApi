# MeducateAPI Project Memory

## Project Overview
Medical education REST API platform. Transforms raw health data (MedlinePlus, PubMed) into structured topics, categorised into 24 body-system/content-type categories, using GPT-4 via Semantic Kernel. Daily automated refresh via Hangfire jobs.

- **Domain**: meducateapi.com (API: api.meducateapi.com)
- **Hosting**: Railway (hobby tier), Cloudflare CDN/DNS
- **Monitoring**: UptimeRobot on both domains

## Architecture
Clean Architecture with 6 projects. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for full details.

| Project | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Meducate.Domain` | Entities, interfaces, zero dependencies |
| `Meducate.Application` | Hangfire jobs, ingestion/refresh services |
| `Meducate.Infrastructure` | EF Core + PostgreSQL, OpenAI, Resend email, data providers |
| `Meducate.API` | Minimal API endpoints, middleware pipeline, auth |
| `Meducate.Web` | Blazor Server dashboard (separate app, calls the API) |
| `Meducate.Tests` | Unit/integration tests |

## Key Entities
- **HealthTopic** — core medical topic with structured fields (summary, observations, factors, actions, citations)
- **User** — passwordless magic-link auth (no passwords)
- **Organisation** — owns API keys (max 5 active)
- **ApiClient** — API key with bcrypt hashing, daily limits
- **ApiUsageLog** — per-request tracking, GDPR-compliant IP truncation
- **SeenTopic** — deduplication for discovery pipeline

## Auth Flow
Magic-link email → verify token → cookie `meducateapi_auth` (8hr expiry, 7-day max, sliding renewal). CSRF via `X-Requested-By` header. Security stamp checked every 5 min.

## User Preferences
- **Commits**: Squash everything into single commit, amend + force push. Same commit message: "MeducateAPI - Medical education API platform"
- **Style**: No emojis, concise responses
- **Data recovery**: Not concerned about DB backups — Hangfire jobs can reload data in ~1 hour
- **Confirmation**: If the next step is trivially implied by the task, complete it without asking for confirmation first.

## Key File Paths
See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for comprehensive file listing.

## SEO
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml in `src/Meducate.Web/wwwroot/`
- Meta descriptions + canonical URLs on Home, Docs, Register pages
- OG/Twitter cards configured in App.razor
- Sitemaps submitted to Google Search Console

## Writing & Style
- No em dashes in any written output. They are a recognisable AI writing pattern; use commas, colons, or parentheses instead. This applies especially to professional and job application writing.

## External Services
- **Resend** — email delivery (magic links, rate limit alerts)
- **OpenAI GPT-4** — topic extraction/classification via Semantic Kernel
- **MedlinePlus + PubMed** — data sources
- **Hangfire** — background jobs (discovery 2AM UTC, refresh 3AM UTC)
